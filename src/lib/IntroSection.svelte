				Hello! You caught me in the middle of spicing up my website. I hadn't updated it in about a year and a half, and I figured this
				would be a good time to experiment with some of the cool features Svelte has to offer.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-8 max-w-4xl text-xl text-gray-600 lg:mx-auto leading-relaxed">
				The TL;DR is I started coding seriously in 2014 and I've been lucky enough to work in a lot of different environments - startups,
				local businesses, contracting, big companies you've heard of (Disney/Hulu), and crypto.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-8 max-w-4xl text-xl text-gray-600 lg:mx-auto leading-relaxed">
				I'm a full-stack engineer, but I tend to work on the frontend more than the backend. I've done a lot with React and TypeScript on
				the frontend, and I work with Node.js or Python on the backend. I find trying new technologies regularly - like GraphQL or the
				aforementioned Svelte - keeps things interesting.
